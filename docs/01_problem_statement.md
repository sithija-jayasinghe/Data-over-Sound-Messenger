# Problem Statement

## Background
Data transmission is a fundamental aspect of modern communication systems. However, there are scenarios where traditional methods such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks are unavailable or impractical. In such cases, alternative methods like data-over-sound can provide a viable solution by leveraging existing hardware such as speakers and microphones.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project stems from the need to enable offline communication in environments where internet connectivity is limited or non-existent. This could be useful in remote areas, during natural disasters, or in secure environments where wireless communication is restricted.

## Real-World Use Cases
1. **Emergency Communication**: Transmitting critical information during disasters when traditional networks are down.
2. **IoT Devices**: Enabling communication between devices without requiring additional hardware.
3. **Secure Data Transfer**: Providing a layer of security by using ultrasonic frequencies that are inaudible to humans.
4. **Education**: Demonstrating the principles of digital signal processing (DSP) and communication systems.

## Goals
- Develop a system capable of transmitting text data using ultrasonic sound.
- Ensure reliable encoding and decoding of data.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving messages.
- Implement error detection and correction mechanisms.

## Out-of-Scope Items
- High-speed data transmission.
- Long-distance communication beyond the range of typical microphones and speakers.
- Support for non-ultrasonic frequencies.

## Value Proposition
This project offers a cost-effective and innovative solution for offline communication using readily available hardware. It serves as both a practical tool and an educational resource for understanding DSP concepts.
