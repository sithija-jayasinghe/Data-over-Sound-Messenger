# Problem Statement

## Background
Data-over-sound communication is an innovative method of transmitting data using sound waves. It leverages the ubiquity of speakers and microphones in modern devices to enable offline data transfer.

## Motivation
In scenarios where traditional wireless communication methods (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) are unavailable or impractical, data-over-sound provides a reliable alternative. This technology is particularly useful in environments with limited connectivity.

## Real-World Use Cases
- Sharing contact information in offline settings
- Secure data exchange in air-gapped environments
- IoT device pairing without network dependency

## Goals
- Develop a system to transmit text data using ultrasonic sound (18–20 kHz).
- Ensure reliable encoding, transmission, and decoding of data.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving messages.

## Out-of-Scope Items
- High-bandwidth data transmission
- Long-distance communication beyond typical speaker-microphone range

## Value Proposition
This project demonstrates the potential of sound-based communication as a low-cost, hardware-independent solution for offline data transfer.
