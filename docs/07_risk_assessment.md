# Risk Assessment

## Risks

### Hearing Sensitivity
- **Risk**: Ultrasonic frequencies may cause discomfort to some individuals.
- **Mitigation**: Limit transmission duration and provide warnings.

### Hardware Variability
- **Risk**: Differences in microphone and speaker quality may affect performance.
- **Mitigation**: Test on a wide range of devices.

### Decoding Errors
- **Risk**: Background noise may lead to incorrect decoding.
- **Mitigation**: Implement noise filtering and checksum validation.

### CPU Usage
- **Risk**: FFT analysis may consume significant CPU resources.
- **Mitigation**: Optimize FFT implementation and processing pipeline.
