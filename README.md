# Data-over-Sound Messenger

## Introduction
The Data-over-Sound Messenger is an innovative system that transmits text data offline using ultrasonic sound (18–20 kHz). It leverages speakers and microphones to enable communication without traditional wireless networks.

## How It Works
1. **Encoding**: Text is converted to binary, mapped to ultrasonic tones, and transmitted via speakers.
2. **Decoding**: Microphones capture the sound, and the system reconstructs the original text using FFT.

## Features
- Offline text transmission
- Ultrasonic frequency range (18–20 kHz)
- Error detection with checksum
- User-friendly interface

## Risks & Ethics
- **Hearing Sensitivity**: Ultrasonic frequencies may cause discomfort to some individuals.
- **Hardware Variability**: Performance may vary across devices.

## Roadmap
- Enhance noise filtering
- Add support for longer messages
- Optimize for low-end devices
